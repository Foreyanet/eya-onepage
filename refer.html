    <h1>How to Refer to Yi-Ya</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      This page provides guidance on how to refer to Yi-Ya in academic papers,
      theses, preprints, and research reports.
    </p>

    <h2>General Principle</h2>
    <p>
      Yi-Ya is intended to be referred to as a <strong>shared research framework</strong>,
      not as a dataset, software tool, or experimental protocol.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Reference Language</h2>
    <p>Researchers may use formulations such as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “This study adopts the Yi-Ya research framework, a shared observational and
      comparative framework for early speech onset (0–3 years), to structure the
      description and comparison of early vocal units across participants.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      “Our observational dimensions are informed by the Yi-Ya framework, which
      defines a method-neutral and cross-study comparable approach to early speech
      onset.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      These formulations may be adapted to fit disciplinary style and journal conventions.
    </p>

    <h2>Citation</h2>
    <p>
      Yi-Ya does not require citation to a single paper. When appropriate, authors
      may cite the project website:
    </p>

    <p><strong>Yi-Ya Research Framework</strong><br>
    https://www.eya.net</p>

    <h2>Authorship and Attribution</h2>
    <p>
      Use of the Yi-Ya framework does not imply co-authorship, endorsement,
      or prior approval. Researchers retain full ownership of their study design,
      data, analysis, and conclusions.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact (Optional)</h2>
    <p>
      Contact with the Yi-Ya initiator is not required. Researchers may choose
      to reach out only if they wish to discuss cross-study alignment or contribute
      to framework refinement.
