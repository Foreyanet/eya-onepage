    <h1>How to Use Yi-Ya</h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Yi-Ya can be used as a lightweight research framework to structure observation,
      description, and comparison of early speech onset. No specific tools, software,
      or centralized protocol are required.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Yi-Ya Is For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Researchers studying early vocal development or speech onset (0–3 years).</li>
      <li>Graduate students designing exploratory or longitudinal studies.</li>
      <li>Labs seeking cross-study comparability without changing their core methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Using Yi-Ya Requires</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear documentation of early vocal observations.</li>
      <li>Consistent descriptive units across participants or time points.</li>
      <li>Transparent reporting of observation context and selection criteria.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Using Yi-Ya Does Not Require</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No use of a specific app or platform.</li>
      <li>No submission of data to a central repository.</li>
      <li>No approval or coordination with the Yi-Ya initiator.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: A Non-App Yi-Ya Study</h2>
    <p>
      A doctoral student conducts monthly home-based audio recordings of infants
      aged 6–24 months. Vocalizations are segmented and described using a small
      set of consistent observational categories (e.g., syllable shape, repetition,
      stability over time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Yi-Ya is used to frame how these observations are reported and compared across
      participants, allowing later dialogue with other studies using similar
      descriptive logic, without sharing data or methods.
    </p>

    <h2>Using Yi-Ya Over Time</h2>
    <p>
      Researchers may adopt Yi-Ya partially or incrementally. The framework is
      designed to support exploratory work and gradual refinement rather than
      fixed experimental outcomes.
